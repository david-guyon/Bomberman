###Last added functions:

* User can move the Player with arrows
* Player cannot go through walls and breakable walls

* When the timeout is triggered, fire blocks are diplayed until they find a wall

###To do:

* Improve all asset images
* Fix few bugs when we navigate at the bottom and at the right of the game area
* Drop items randomly when a breakable block is destroyed
* Add a second user using the Node.js technologie
* Create an UI displaying information for each player
* Fix the bug that the player is behind bombs and fire blocks
